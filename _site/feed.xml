&lt;p&gt;(Unfortunately the Twitter plugin still doesn’t work, so I’m just gonna link the Tweets and quote them.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RealDorianDawes/status/894752724318797825&quot;&gt;As a quote to the following tweet:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The case for firing James Damore (Google engineer) is that his memo created a hostile workplace. I think that’s true if he acts on memo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The literature ITSELF was hostile m’dude. Hostile literature is covered in most company HR policies. How are you so ignorant of this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It certainly wasn’t. It was phrased very carefully to avoid hostility. Emphasizing that all these are differences on average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/aanand/status/894741503570063361&quot;&gt;Of course James is a bigot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Anyone angry about Google firing that guy: don’t worry, they’ve probably let a thousand other bigots off the hook, you’re fine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply voicing his opinion is bigotry, makes sense. Plus, it’s not like he said something outragous without something to back it up. What he said is well grounded. But nope, he’s a “pejudiced or close-minded person” (Sounds more fitting to the ones accusing him of bigotry anyway)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure I’m glad that someone &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/der_Grobi/status/894746393453051906&quot;&gt;lost his job&lt;/a&gt;, I mean, it’s &lt;img src=&quot;https://twitter.com/der_Grobi/status/894755968986136576&quot; alt=&quot;his fault&quot; /&gt; for using his right of free speech&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want to say I’m glad but knowing Silicon Valley I’m also sure this guy will not be jobless for long. Watch him end up at Oculus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Debate fascists, don’t no-platform them! The Google guy may stink, but don’t fire him! Don’t punch Nazis, you’re just as violent as them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or you’re just blind to all &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/susanthesquark/status/894740662884614144&quot;&gt;but your opinion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jobhaver/status/894227204858576902&quot;&gt;Yet this tweet shows perfectly well, how good they’re at it&lt;/a&gt;. It even has 200 retweets and 500 likes by the time I write this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It always feels like they never heard of the streisand effect, although this is a bit different. Usually it says to better keep your mouth shut about something that you don’t want to see published, since making deal out of it will only shift more attention towards it. In this case, it’s rather how they can’t fathom different opinions and the fact, that their action will bring a reaction. Historically, many movements gave birth to a counter-movement. Or an action was followed by a reaction. In the the second half of the 18th century the Age of “Sturm und Drang” in Germany came only to existence because literature at that time was dominated by the Age of Enlightenment. During Hitler’s rise many counter-movements, such as the anti-fascist action itself, sprung up to oppose him. This goes on and on, because we don’t have the same mentality, opinion or priorities. Just because you think your actions are legitimate doesn’t mean someone else does. Not even if they agree with your views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main problems here is, that antifas attack what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; deem fascist. So if they think Trump supporters help a fascist, they could rally against them. However, the people themselves are likely not fascists. Trump may even be one, but if you rally against them, you attack &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; not Trump. You attack their right to gather march for their political believe. Since these supporters think they’re right, they will dismiss these antifascists as violent. From their perspective, it’s an attack on them. Of course this is also shown in the media repeatedly, so those who don’t align with the antifa’s views, will be against them. An anti-antifa so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s even more amazing about this, is the fact that antifa is very much authorian themselves. They want to dictate what which opinion is right and which one is wrong. They want to decide what can be said and discussed and what can’t. This is inheritly authorian, even if they want to shut down nazis exclusively. That’s because you have to identify nazis first. That’s already bad enough, since there’s no way to draw a clear line anyway. On top of that, you can’t know what a person will say before they say it. So even if you manage to determine what is racist and what who is racist, you can’t just forbid them to voice their opinion. That would simultaneously mean a nazi can’t talk about climate change or economy anymore, because he’s racist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another trait that fits to the authorian picture is their view on violence. There’s a good reason why the government has a monopoly on violence in democracies. Any other form of violence that does not follow a set, transparent law will foster fear. It is by definition arbitary, since no one knows what others think or how they react. Antifascists now argue, that violence is neccessary against certain views. Anyone else can’t follow their line of thought though, so it’s unclear who is a target to them and who isn’t. Earlier this year, antifas argued that it’s okay to punch nazis, because it’s self-defense. Because nazis are gonna cause harm to others, it’s perfectly fine to harm them first. Now, if we follow this logic, it can be reversed too. The tweet above implies, that the author of the article is a fascist in the eyes of certain people. Since I agree with the article, I could’ve technically written it similarly, so I’d be a fascist in their eyes too. And well, since antifas are against fascists obviously and don’t have any qualms to resort to violence, following their logic, it’d be perfectly fine for me to get the first hit in. To make it worse, I don’t even know who wants me harm and who doesn’t unless they come at me with their raised. But in that case, I don’t even need such a logic to come to that conclusion, so this logic fails in itself. It fails even more at resolving the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so the award for the least self-aware group in the United States of America goes to… the Antifascist Action! Congratulations&lt;/p&gt;

An Iowan student newspaper published an article about &lt;a href=&quot;http://daily-iowan.com/2017/07/25/williams-what-is-privilege-and-what-do-we-do-with-it/&quot;&gt;privilege&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article is all kinds of stupid, peaking at the “cognitive privilege”, but at its core, it still fits at what I explained earlier, so why not take it apart?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The relevant notion of privilege I define as the receipt of certain benefits wholly through accident of birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is interesting in this case, since the author, Williams, is also talking about white privilege there. He may want to say being white is nothing but advantegeous, but this is the line of thinking that leads to racism. Color does not grant you anything others couldn’t achieve the same way. I’m aware the US is still more racist than most other countries on this side of the Atlantic, but it’s not so extreme, that it will stop your career in the tracks. Blacks, too, can go to school, as bad as it is, graduate, go to college, pay high fees, and eventually hit off well. They can also fail in the process or luck out with a good idea. None of this has much to do with skin color though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are many kinds of privilege besides white privilege: cognitive privilege, for example. We now know that intelligence is not something we have significant control over but is something we are born with. We are living in a society in which success is increasingly linked to one’s intelligence. This is not to say that intelligence is the only factor that is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course intelligence is a deciding factor for success and parts of it are linked to birth, yes. John Stuart Mill would’ve never started off as the genius child he is, if his father didn’t have a huge library he could basically devour in his early years. It fostered his already existent potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But when doing so, we must also bear in mind the purpose of drawing attention to privileges. The purpose is not to instill a sort of Catholic guilt in someone’s psyche, nor is it an excuse to make oneself feel better by demonizing another. The purpose of pointing out someone’s privilege is to remind them of the infinite number of experiences that are possible and the very large number of experiences that are actual that they know very little about. The purpose is to enlarge their moral consciousness, to make them more sympathetic to people who are less fortunate than they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me some of this privilege babbling sounds more like an excuse for your own failure. “He’s just smarter than me, it’s no wonder he doing better than me.” or “Well, he was born white, naturally he’d end up on top of me.” don’t really increase your self-esteem. We need challenges to overcome ourselves. To go back to Mill, he didn’t become a genius just through by being smart, he actually had to read hundreds, thousands of books to acquire the knowledge he later used. The same goes for Gauß or other mathematicians. They sat down and calculated for hours, days, weeks, months to come to the conclusions that made them famous. Seriously, Gauß didn’t have a calculator, so he had to go through his calculations over and over again for more than half a year, using tens of thousands pieces of paper in the process. That’s the sort of dedication you need for real success. It doesn’t come “naturally” to those who are born “privileged”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Feelings of guilt are natural when coming to consciousness of one’s place in the scheme of things — and noticing that one has been conferred benefits through sheer accident — but guilt is an impediment to social-justice action, not a motivator (guilt slides easily into resentment). Keeping the general notion of “privilege” in mind allows us to notice that there are different species of privilege. We can debate whether “whiteness” is a sort of “master privilege” that overrules all others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lastly, don’t guilt trip people for no reason. I don’t and never will feel guilty over my birth. I’m lucky enough to not be born into poverty or a family of abusive, irresponsible parents, yes. But that shouldn’t be seen as something to feel guilty about. It should rather be seen as the norm and not something to feel negative about. Likewise, why should it be a bad thing to be born off well? Even if you raise awareness of those who were lucky, what does it help them? Yeah, they had a pretty simple life, they’re well off, but they can’t change anything about it either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It certainly doesn’t help that the left’s goals, motivations and reasons are all over the place. While this fellow doesn’t want to demonize whites and intellectuals, others do exactly that. Another group guilt trips whites. Yet they have very similar views, so they mix up in some twisted mindset that contradicts itself. Thinking about it, that’s pretty interesting in itself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This is basically a follow up from the last post.

&lt;p&gt;I mean fundamentally, they’re pretty close to my believes. They also want equality, education for everyone, are against big corporations. Yet there’s also a fundamental difference and I think I can put my finger on that. To illustrate, here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RealDorianDawes/status/893155181621387264&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; of someone who qualifies as part of that group. The tweets around it put it into context, but that one alone practically show the difference between us. 
What I mainly mean is the racist part. Capitalism isn’t racist, it’s just problematic. I share the idea of capitalism being way to predominant in this world, absolutely. Single individuals or even certain groups shouldn’t be able to exert as much power as they do with their money. See for example Soros or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thenation.com/article/goldmans-greek-gambit/&quot;&gt;Goldman Sachs&lt;/a&gt; who can influence countries. But even on a smaller scale, lobbyists heavily influence politicians whereas common folk have nothing. 
But capitalism isn’t racist. Looking at Europe more than 100 years back, it already existed and extremely profitable for the rich. Those who owned capital could determine who gets work and who doesn’t. It was a completely onesided display of power, even though it was a lot more homogenous than it is now. Capitalists don’t care about skincolor, not at all. All they want is success. That’s the nature of a successful person who made it big. Thinking otherwise leads to very different conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I also don’t think capitalism is THE evil of the world. Capitalism and democracy both shape our western world, yet they both have fundamental flaws in their current state. Democracy only represents a few, not the majority. Capitalism at its core leads to very badly distributed wealth. Yet we don’t have good alternatives. Money in itself is a good tool to trade goods. And I honestly think capitalism could work out in some way, albeit very regulated. Financial capitalism would need to be abolished altogether or at least made unprofitable. Banks in general should be a lot more regulated to not lend out money as they want to generate more. And so on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there’s still the main problem with that line of thought like I described above: It doesn’t lead to equality. Currently the popular political believe is that of the evil white man who ruled for way too long, so we need others in power now. To have diversity. Let them be black, female, disabled, trans, gay. It doesn’t matter as long as they aren’t cis, white and male. They don’t even need to be president, other high positions are also accomplishments. They completely disregard political diversity. Well not completely, even they didn’t wanted to see the warmongering Hillary Clinton in office. Yet these very people celebrate every time a “special” person accomplishes something, as if their sexuality has something to do with it. Sure I want to live in a world where sexuality doesn’t interfere with your career, much like I don’t want the church to interfere with politics. But forcing it isn’t good either. It’s racist, sexist, ablist, etc. Exactly what they’re trying to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fight for the underdog is sickening. Helping those you deem oppressed only helps those you deem oppressed, of course. That left only thinks of good guys vs bad guys. They’re the obvious good guys, flawless in their views, others are the bad guys. Those who are oppressed need to helped. They completely miss out on the fact, that they need to identify these first. To identify them, they need to specify who is oppressed. So first you claim who is oppressed, then you identify those, then you help them. That’s exactly what I hate about that idea. It’s not really about equality, otherwise you’d just help just about anyone who needs help. It’s like telling a young white boy with alcoholic parents living in poverty “I’m sorry, we don’t have any programs for you, we can’t help you”. Just because he fits the same criteria as Trump, Bush, Gates, etc. doesn’t mean he’s as well off as them. (Mind you, it’s also mind-boggling how women who take up more than half the population are deemed oppressed. I doubt many of them feel actively oppressed in the western world.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extending an arm to those in need is what brings equality. It’s the very thing Jesus did. He helped others indiscriminately, not based on sex, origin or whether they were missing a limb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that all is pretty much the difference between my equality to theirs. Theirs is a more authorian approach, since someone has to determine whether a group is (still) oppressed or not. Praising and glorifying those who accomplished something “despite” being a women, black person, etc also implies that it is to be expected from those who aren’t of those categories. Say a girl comes out on the top of her year in mathematics, she’d be praised for that. But in the first place, she can only be praised for that, because it’s seen as a boys thing. Her accomplishment in itself isn’t any more praiseworthy as that of the boys before her, every year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I think I’m starting to understand why I loathe the “other left”.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Transgender gene</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Transgender-Gene/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Transgender gene" /><published>2017-08-03T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-08-03T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Transgender-Gene</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Transgender-Gene/">&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lgbt-biology-idUSKBN1AJ0F0&quot;&gt;this artcile by Reuters&lt;/a&gt; something weird came up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m all for research before action. It’s basically “think before you act” on a bigger scale, the scale of politics. So I welcome such a research before decisions are made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That quest has made some transgender people nervous. If a “cause” is found it could posit a “cure,” potentially opening the door to so-called reparative therapies similar to those that attempt to turn gay people straight, advocates say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many genetic diseases can we cure again? Autism? Down-syndrome? Dementia? We’re still practically defenseless against genetics, so I don’t see that worry. Being transgender isn’t even a hindrance per se.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One-third of transgender people reported a negative healthcare experience in the previous year such as verbal harassment, refusal of treatment or the need to teach their doctors about transgender care, according to a landmark survey of nearly 28,000 people released last year by the National Center for Transgender Equality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verbal harassment is a no-go, refusal of treatment shouldn’t happen regularly either, but needing to teach doctors about transgender care? We have gynecologists who specialize in women, exactly because we need such specialists for some cases. What do you exepct? Transgender isn’t that common, that every doctor in the country knows his or her share on the topic. Medicine is a wide field, so wide that it needs many different specialists to treat correctly. Doctors also hold a lot of responsibility. That’s why it’s foolish to assume every doctor will help you. Doctors are allowed to refuse treatment because of that. They should be. That is of course if it doesn’t fall under his or her specialty. A hospital refusing a wounded would be a scandal under normal circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Reading this artcile by Reuters something weird came up.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">German Cabaret</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/German-Cabaret/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="German Cabaret" /><published>2017-06-24T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-06-24T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/German-Cabaret</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/German-Cabaret/">&lt;p&gt;It’s such a shame I can almost never recommend German Cabaret to my internation friends.
