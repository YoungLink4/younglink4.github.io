I wonder if you can make lots of neat stuff with this. Not that it needs to, considering I don't plan to do any of the sort. But hey, as long as I can quote and include links, it'd be fine.

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

#How do you comment
//this? Prolly not
##Is this box?
hfa
##Apparently not
Oh well, we'll see
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
