title: German Cabaret

It's such a shame I can almost never recommend German Cabaret to my internation friends. Some of it manages to be the perfect mix of humour and critique on the ruling class. 

[Look at Volker Pispers for example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SG0Ql0VfcRg&t=3s). A truly knowledgable man, showing us the the problems of our time. Even this one, performed 14 years ago, still stays relevant. His ability to predict some events is almost scary.

It's also a shame there isn't an English equivalent. Nothing goes really deep into the political structure. Basically all the criticism that comes around, can be compared to the daily show: Superficial, mainly making fun of the politicians.
