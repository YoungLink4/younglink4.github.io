title: About this blog
---

So this commences my own first blog, let's see how it'll work out and if any read this. It's purpose is basically for me to vent out and produce some texts, albeit I'd be happy if some folks follow it regularly and spread it. That said, I'm kinda eager to write every now and then, hopefully for everyone who comes to like it, my enthusiasm won't cool down too quickly. Or I run out of ideas to write about. But seeing the world and its people heat up with every day passing, becoming more and more extreme while name-calling everyone else either left or right, I don't see that happening any time soon. On the other hand I'm scared to repeat myself over and over again.

Anyway, welcome to this politically incorrect, thoughtless-thoughtful, politic-philosophical, naive, idealistic, dreamy blog.
