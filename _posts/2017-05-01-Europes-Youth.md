title: Europe's youth would revolt

[Well that's interesting](https://qz.com/971374/europes-youth-dont-care-to-vote-but-theyre-ready-to-join-a-mass-revolt/)

More than half of Europe's would actually revolt against their government. I'd say it's no wonder when the political parties and their core members are older than their parents and mainly targeting old folks with their policies. We young ones just don't see any benefit coming to us.
