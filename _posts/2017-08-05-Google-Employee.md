A Google employee is talking about Google's [political agenda](http://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320). It's quite interesting.

But really, why don't people just lay back and let things happen. You don't need to force things. If women don't wanna go into tech that much, then you don't have many women in tech. It's a shame but not such a big problem.
