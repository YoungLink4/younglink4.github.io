Somehow whenever it comes to Trump, things start to get weird.

  1. Trump [talks](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/world/europe/last-night-in-sweden-trumps-remark-baffles-a-nation.html) about the migration in Sweden. Even though nothing happened the night before there.
  >You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this?
  
  2. Then he [explains](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/donald-trump-explains-sweden-terror-comment-baffled-nation-n723006) his comment, saying it didn't point to a specific event, but rather something Fox News broadcasted earlier. (Which kinda doesn't make it any better at all)
  
  3. [Riots](http://www.torontosun.com/2017/02/21/riot-breaks-out-in-predominantly-immigrant-suburb-in-sweden) break out and cars burn.

It really is all jumbled up. Or maybe it's just that we live in a post facto time. First the facts, then the evidence.
