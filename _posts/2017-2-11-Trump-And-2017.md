[Today in news: Trump doesn't wanna](http://www.rawstory.com/2017/02/he-doesnt-like-this-sht-trump-reportedly-hates-his-job-and-his-staff-after-less-than-a-month/)

I wouldn't trust this site too much, but on the other hand it's not too far-fetched either. We basically have a new guy in the office who just begun his career as politician. He began his political career as the president, that's... so much. Interesting, ridiculous, brave, foolish, remarkable, short-sighted. All of them come to mind when thinking about it. You don't try out something you're bound to for the next 4 years. He isn't even good at it as seen with his first executive orders. Banning immigration from some arbitary countries won't solve anything. As seen already it brings more problems. 

The [other order](http://nypost.com/2017/02/04/trump-scales-back-banking-regulations-with-executive-order/) reduces bank regulations. Aside from the fact, that this is quite the opposite of "draining the swamp", which no one really expected to happen in the first place considering his background. This order reverts the regulations set after the big Lehman crash in the last decade. Honestly speaking, I overestimated Trump and his political skills. I thought he'd have more foresight and intelligence to understand his decisions and what they mean. 

That means we're looking forward to an exciting year of 2017. Maybe we'll see if Trump was the better choice to improve relationships with Russia. [This article](https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/trial-balloon-for-a-coup-e024990891d5#.pe73xd8py) suggests it is. 

>Finally, I want to highlight a story that many people haven’t noticed. On Wednesday, Reuters reported (in great detail) how 19.5% of Rosneft, Russia’s state oil company, has been sold to parties unknown. This was done through a dizzying array of shell companies, so that the most that can be said with certainty now is that the money “paying” for it was originally loaned out to the shell layers by VTB (the government’s official bank), even though it’s highly unclear who, if anyone, would be paying that loan back; and the recipients have been traced as far as some Cayman Islands shell companies.

>Why is this interesting? Because the much-maligned Steele Dossier (the one with the golden showers in it) included the statement that Putin had offered Trump 19% of Rosneft if he became president and removed sanctions. The reason this is so interesting is that the dossier said this in July, and the sale didn’t happen until early December. And 19.5% sounds an awful lot like “19% plus a brokerage commission.”

>Conclusive? No. But it raises some very interesting questions for journalists to investigate.

Afterwards the German parliament election will be in full throttle. With the AfD as Germanys answer to Trump, our media who will probably try to put them in a bad light, but fail glamorously. As they say, any publicity, be it positive or negative, is good publicity. No one knows what to vote for except for the elder, who just vote for the same yet again. So CDU/CSU with Merkel on the will win yet again. AfD surpasses SPD and join the parliament. Possibly as governing party right on the spot, cause SPD, Green party and the Lefts lose voters in the thousands. It's interesting. 
As to why I'm so sure how it turns out, here's a graphic about the number of legal voters.

![Table of eligible voters](https://github.com/YoungLink4/younglink4.github.io/blob/master/images/Wahlberechtigte.jpg?raw=true)

On the left we have it divided in age groups. The colomns are male, female and total respectively. Additionally the bottom shows how many are allowed to vote for first time. 
If you sum up everyone of age 60 and above (those who don't need to work anymore) roughly one in three are able to vote. If you take the next age group from the bottom, 50-60 into this calculation, you end up with 34.4 million voters out of 61.5. Over half the ones eligible to vote are way past the midpoint of their life. That's gonna be a good election campaign this year. Change is the last thing that comes to mind.

Time to grab some snacks with a few drinks and enjoy the show then.
