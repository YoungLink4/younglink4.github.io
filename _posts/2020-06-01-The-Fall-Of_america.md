Currently the US is in all kinds of turmoil and many are shocked at what's happening, me included. However I'm mostly shocked at specific events like [a protester being pulled out while giving a speech](https://twitter.com/sweeeetdee_/status/1267319103167107072); [the national gueard walking through a street, giving orders to civilians and shooting a non-lethal round at that house](https://streamable.com/u2jzoo); or [someone being shot by a non-lethal round for no apparent reason](https://twitter.com/MemeMations/status/1267190267750133761?s=20). It's not too surprising that a protest with a large crowd has rioters and people easily instigated, that's just mob mentality at its work. What is surprising is the police being incredibly aggressive very early on with cases like [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cnn-reporting-crew-arrested-camera-police-minneapolis-n1217651](a CNN crew being arrested while filming) or [attacking a crew that's broadcasting live](https://youtu.be/gprIBmd_9go). What I'm least surprised about, though, is the event of protests like these in general. In my eyes the US is a faulty system, that's just riddled with weaknesses. The new pandemic simply exploits those weaknesses which turns everything upside down. Here I just want to list those weaknesses and try to work out how they affect each other.

### The Election System



Interesting, [there's an interview](http://www.businessinsider.de/female-google-employee-responds-to-james-damore-memo-2017-8?r=US&IR=T) of a female Google employee on the Damore thing. They promise a good read, so let's see what it's about.
